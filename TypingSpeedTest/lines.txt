It's been a long time since we met. Great to see you again!
No other country is as rich as India in spiritual heritage.
Do not worry, everything is adjusted to just fit in the given frame.
The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking.
Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.
It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.
Comfort is no test of truth. On the contrary, truth is far from comfortable.
It never gets easier, only you have to get stronger.
Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.
To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
It is never too late to be what you might have been.
